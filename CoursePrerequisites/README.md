Environment Setup and Prerequisites for the openSAP course "Cloud-Native Development with SAP Cloud Platform"
=====================================================
This files explains the general prerequisites for the openSAP course "Cloud-Native Development with SAP Cloud Platform". To be able to install software on your computer, please make sure you have administrative rights. For a reliable and easy to setup development environment we provide a virtual machine (VM). 

The VM runs an **Ubuntu Linux** system and offers basically all tools and configuration that are required within the course. If you are not familiar with Unix/Linux, you can check out [Learn Unix in 10 Minutes](https://csg.sph.umich.edu/docs/hints/learnUNIXin10minutes.html) or [Introduction to Linux](http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/index.html) or with a little more detail [Learn Linux in 5 Days](https://linuxtrainingacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/learn-linux-in-5-days.pdf) (it actually takes a lot less time). There is also a very good [Linux Commandline Cheat Sheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LinuxCommandLineCheatSheet.pdf).

# Technical Prerequisites

## 1. Prepare your Development Environment
* **VM Setup**: Please follow the [installations steps](../VMImage/VMImage_GettingStarted.md) to prepare your VM image that provides the whole development environment.

## 2. Prepare your Trial Account, Organization, and Space in the Cloud Foundry Environment within SAP Cloud Platform
* Create your own **Trial Account, Organization, and Space** in the **Cloud Foundry Environment within SAP Cloud Platform** by registering [**here**](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com) for a Trial Account (or logging in if you already have one) and then starting your **Cloud Foundry Trial**.

# Test your Knowledge - Are you Ready for the Training?

* **Spring**: In this course we are using `Spring` as Dependency Injection Framework to achieve loose coupling. Beside of that is Spring currently the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use the [Spring Framework](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/overview.html) to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code. The Spring Framework is an open source Java platform. If you want to learn more about the Spring Framework have a look at this [Spring Framework playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB8k2-Egfv0&list=PLC97BDEFDCDD169D7).
